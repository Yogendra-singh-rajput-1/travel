                        The ‘Temple City’, Ujjain, is usually thronged by Hindu pilgrims. The city is home to scores of
                        old and new temples, making it a significant religious spot in India to visit. In any case,
                        Ujjain isn’t just for the Hindu pilgrims as there are several places in the city that are
                        remarkable from the point of view of tourism. Located on the bank of River Shipra, Ujjain is
                        also the scene of the renowned Kumbh Mela. Also, the city has several historical places that
                        introduces tourists to its affluent past.

                    <p>
                        Amarnath Cave is accessible only during the Sharavan months of July-August.
                        There are two routes available for undertaking the Amarnath Yatra - via Baltal or Pahalgam.
                        The Baltal route, though shorter, has a steeper trekking route.
                        The Pahalgam route is longer but is generally preferred by most of the devotees.
                        It usually takes 3-5 days to reach Amarnath from the base point. Helicopter services are now
                        available by private operators on both these routes.
                        The devotees need to make advance bookings and get registered to undertake the holy pilgrimage
                        to Amarnath.

                        They say that the connection between God and a devotee is a special one; the almighty listens to
                        your prayers. He is the creator of the universe, guiding everyone to the right path. With these
                        holy places in India, devotees are sure to strengthen their bond with God!

                        It is known that it was built by Pandavas and then again revived by the saint Adi Shankaracharya

                    <h3>Rishikesh</h3>
                    <p>
                        Rishikesh became known worldwide in the 1960s after The Beatles visited the ashram of Maharishi
                        Mahesh Yogi here. Today, the place is popular as The Beatles Ashram which beckons tourists
                        globally. The tranquil town has long been a spiritual centre but is equally popular for the
                        whitewater rafting, bungee jumping, mountain biking and camping along the fast-flowing Holy
                        Ganges. It also serves as the gateway to many Himalayan treks.

                        As it lies on the holy banks of river Ganga, Rishikesh has been a hub of Sadhus (saints) with
                        numerous ashrams teaching spirituality, yoga, meditation and Ayurveda springing up. Since it is
                        a religious town, non-vegetarian food and alcohol are strictly prohibited here.

                    <h3>Haridwar</h3>
                    <p>
                        Every evening, Haridwar is witness to a set of rituals for the famous Ganga Aarti at the Ghats
                        (River Banks) where thousands of devotees come together to pray to the river. Once in every
                        twelve years, Haridwar is host to the mega-gathering during the world famous Kumbh Mela which
                        sees millions of visitors from all over the country. Along with Prayagraj, Nashik and Ujjain,
                        Haridwar is one of the only four cities in India which can host the Kumbh Mela.

                        Haridwar also acts as the base destination for some of the other tourist towns of Rishikesh and
                        Devprayag as Hardwar is well connected by trains and roads. Apart from the religious angle,
                        Haridwar is also now developing as a multifaceted cultural and spiritual centre.

                    <p>
                        Badrinath Temple remains closed for six months from November to April each year. The temple is
                        closed for worship on the auspicious day of bhatridwityia in October. On the day of the closure,
                        an Akhanda Jyoti lamp is lit to last for six months and the image of Badrinath is transferred to
                        Narasimha temple at Jyotirmath. Badrinath reopens on Akshaya Tritiya, an auspicious day in April
                        every year.

                        Badrinath Temple has a Tapt Kund, a hot sulphur spring which is considered to have medicinal
                        values. River Alaknanda is known to originate from here. The vibrant festivals of Mata Murti Ka
                        Mela and the Badri Kedar Festival give you another reason to visit the temple.

                    <h3>Prayagraj</h3>
                    <p>
                        Prayag or Prayagraj had been the ancient name of the city of Allahabad. Pra means “first” and
                        Yag means “devotion”. Prayag also signifies the coming together of rivers Ganga, Yamuna and
                        Saraswati. After the Mughal invasion, Emperor Akbar, impressed by the location named the city
                        Ilahabas which meant “Abode of God”. Emperor Shah Jahan, his grandson, renamed the city to
                        Allahabad.

                        One of the top places to visit in Allahabad, if you’re spiritually inclined (and even if you’re
                        not because this place deserves a visit), Triveni Sangam is a place bustling with tourists and
                        locals all year round. The Maha Kumbh Mela is a religious occasion that is held here every
                        twelve years and is attended by millions of pilgrims from all across the globe.
